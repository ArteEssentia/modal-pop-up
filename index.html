		<h1>Modal Pop-Up Demo</h1>

		<!-- Just some random text to suggest page-flow -->
		<p>With modern day CSS there is no need for JavaScript to achieve fancy looking animations and effects. When you click the link below, a modal pop-up will appear, which means all other interactions are temporally blocked until the pop-up is closed.</p>

		<!-- The link that will open the modal pop-up -->
		<a href="#infopanel" class="open_modal">Learn more about this little demonstration.</a>
		
		<!-- The modal_box is the grey overlay that appears to fade the normal page -->
		<div id="infopanel" class="modal_box">
			<!-- The content is the actual modal pop-up -->
			<div class="content">
				<h2>ABOUT THE MODAL BOX</h2>
				<p>This pop-up window is controlled by css only. No scripting necessary!</p>
				<p>When you're done click the X button to close.</p>
				<!-- This div will be the close button in the upper right of the pop-up -->
				<div class="close">
					<!-- The link will move us back to the top of the page -->
					<a href="#">Close</a>
